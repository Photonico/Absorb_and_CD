# Absorb and circular dichroism

Calculation of absorb and circular dichroism.

Background theoretical knowledge

A. Fundamentals of Light–Matter Interaction

* Electromagnetic Theory and Spectroscopy: Cover the basics of electromagnetic wave propagation, wave vectors, polarization, and the principles of spectroscopy.

* Spectral Line Shapes and Broadening Mechanisms: Discuss how spectral lines are modeled (e.g., Lorentzian and Gaussian profiles) and the physical origins of line broadening such as natural lifetime broadening, collisional broadening, and dephasing.2

B. Quantum Mechanics

* Energy Levels and Transitions: Introduce quantum states, selection rules, and the calculation of transition matrix elements.

* Linear Response Theory: Explain how the system's response to an external electromagnetic field is described, which is essential for deriving absorption and CD spectra.

C. Molecular Exciton Theory

* Single-Molecule Excited States and Transition Dipole Moments: Define the concept of an excited state and the role of the transition dipole moment in optical transitions.

* Exciton Models in Aggregates: Describe how exciton states form in dimers and larger aggregates through dipole–dipole interactions, leading to phenomena such as Davydov splitting.

* Point-Dipole Approximation: Discuss when the point-dipole approximation is valid and its limitations in modeling molecular interactions.

D. Supramolecular Chirality and Circular Dichroism (CD)

* Chirality and Supramolecular Assemblies: Explain chirality in molecules and how non-chiral units can assemble into chiral supramolecular structures.

* Principles of Circular Dichroism: Introduce the concept of CD, its measurement (i.e., the difference in absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light), and what it reveals about molecular chirality.

* Rotational Strength and Its Calculation: Define rotational strength, explain its significance in CD spectroscopy, and how it is calculated from the electric and magnetic dipole transitions.

E. Theoretical Approaches in the Literature

* Oscillating Dipole Approach (ODA): Describe how the exciton Hamiltonian is constructed for aggregates and how it is used to compute absorption and CD spectra.

* Polarizable Object Approach (POA): Explain the method of considering the induced polarization in each molecule and their mutual interactions to obtain the spectra.

* Compare the assumptions and applicability of these two approaches, and discuss why they are equivalent under certain approximations.
