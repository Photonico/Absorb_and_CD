#### Development

Currently, the model of this literature is still very crude.

## Interactions included

* Monomer resonance energy
Each molecule is assumed to have a fixed excitation energy (ħω0), which forms the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian.

## Interactions not included

* Environment field interaction

*
