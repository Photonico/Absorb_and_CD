#### Development

Currently, the model of this literature is still very crude.

## Interactions included

* Monomer resonance energy
Each molecule is assumed to have a fixed excitation energy (ħω0), which forms the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian.

* Dipole coupling
The model uses the point-dipole approximation to calculate the interaction between molecules;
The geometrical dipole coupling factor is G_ij.

## Interactions not included

* Environment field interaction

* Short-range exchange interactions

* Higher-order multipole effects
