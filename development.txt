#### Development

Currently, the model of this literature is still very crude.

## Interactions included

* Monomer resonance energy
Each molecule is assumed to have a fixed excitation energy (ħω0), which forms the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian.

* Dipole coupling
The model uses the point-dipole approximation to calculate the interaction between molecules;
The geometrical dipole coupling factor is G_ij.

## Interactions not included

* Environment field interaction

* Short-range exchange interactions
When molecules are very close, electronic wavefunction overlap can lead to exchange interactions.
These are not captured by the point-dipole approximation.

* Higher-order multipole effects
In addition to dipole coupling interactions, higher-order contributions such as quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions might play a role in the coupling,
especially in systems with complex charge distributions.

* Electron–phonon coupling
Vibrational effects can modulate the energy levels and broaden the spectral lines.
Including electron–phonon interactions would provide a more realistic description of the optical spectra.

* Static and dynamic disorder
Real systems often exhibit disorder in molecular positions, orientations, and energies.
Incorporating disorder can account for inhomogeneous broadening and localization effects in the exciton states.
